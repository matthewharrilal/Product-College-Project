# Product-College-Project
A client wants to build a simple wrapper around Product Hunt using the PH API. 
The first feature the client wants you to implement is a feed that displays all of today's featured products. 
The client wants to keep the project lean and asks you explicitly not to use any dependencies or third party libraries
